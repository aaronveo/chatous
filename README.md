=======

This contains project work which uses chatous.com dataset for predicting quality of users and helps in predicting a better matching algorithm.

There are three different source files:

1. kmeans.py : This does the analysis of the dataset and tries to cluster the profiles into categories based on age and gender.

2. classification.py : This runs through various different classification algorithms and applies them on the dataset to find bad users based on their conversation patterns.

3. regression.py : This applies regression algorithms on conversation word vectors to predict the length of the conversation per user.
